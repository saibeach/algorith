Pre-order traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left subtree. Finally, traverse the right subtree.

In-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then visit the root. Finally, traverse the right subtree.

Post-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then traverse the right subtree. Finally, visit the root.
